<h1>Auto Scaling</h1>

<p>
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html">EC2 Auto Scaling</a> is designed to ensure that you have the correct number of instances available to handle the load for your application.
<br />
You create collections of EC2 instances called Auto Scaling groups, which allow you to specify the minimum/maximum number of instances in each group. Your instances are organised into groups so they can be treated as a logical unit for scaling and management purposes.
