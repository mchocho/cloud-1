<h1>Load balancer</h1>

<p>
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html">Elastic Load Balancing</a> automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets (virtual servers) in 1 or more Availability zones. It monitors the health of registered targets, routes traffic only to healthy targets and can automatically scale the workload.
<br />
You configure your load balancer to accepts incoming traffic by specifying one or more listeners. A listener is a process that checks for connection requests. It's configured with a protocol and port number for connections from clients to the load balancer.
